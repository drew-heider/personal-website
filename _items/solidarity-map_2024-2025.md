## About This Item

The secondary source “Romanticizing Rock Music” makes a connection to this object through the ties that the Grateful Dead created to a niche of rock. Also, makes a connection to the art they created outside of the more common side of rock and roll that ended up going mainstream. To many people the Grateful Dead established a free-flowing art form by their “jam-band” sound. The rock and roll music they created was backed by a special community called “Dead Heads” that viewed their creations as art to be shared amongst each other.
